# Red-Black Tree Implementation

![Red-Black Tree Example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Red-black_tree_example.svg)  

This repository contains an implementation of a **Red-Black Tree**, a self-balancing binary search tree. Red-Black Trees ensure that the tree remains balanced, guaranteeing **O(log n)** time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations.

## Overview

A **Red-Black Tree** is a binary search tree with the following properties:
1. Each node is either **red** or **black**.
2. The **root** is always black.
3. Red nodes cannot have red children (no two consecutive red nodes).
4. Every path from a node to its descendant `NULL` pointers has the **same number of black nodes**.
5. New insertions are always red.

This implementation provides a balanced tree structure that is useful for applications requiring efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

## Features

- **Insertion**: Insert new nodes while maintaining the Red-Black Tree properties.
- **Deletion**: Remove nodes while preserving the tree's balance.
- **Search**: Find a node with a specific key in **O(log n)** time.
- **Traversal**: In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal methods.
- **Balancing**: Automatic balancing after insertions and deletions.
